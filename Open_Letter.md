Open Invitation to Participate in CommonAccord

Legal documents are about to be replaced with automated systems.

CommonAccord is an approach to replacing them is open source, public and based on the well-known legal process of codification.  It has been in development since 2008 and is currently being used in a very limited way.  It is entirely open source, available for anyone to use.  Our expectation is that various groups will codify documents relevant to their areas of interest and they will be intergrated into a global network of codification. 

This network of codification should be rooted in civil society and legal institutions.

We invite your participation.  We are seeking (i) partners to help structure an organization to hold and manage the global aspect of the codification, (ii) participants interested in organizing sites for particular fields, industries, jurisdictions or other categories, (iii) lawyers who wish to contribute to codification, (iv) information technologists and companies to contribute to the software base and (v) businesses, not-for-profits and agencies interested in using codification to improve their work.

The project can be contacted at this GitHub site or via any of the participants.

Examples of our work are on this GitHub repo and at sites such as [commonaccord.org](http://commonaccord.org) and [startup.commonaccord.org](http://startup.commonaccord.org) (note that the entire chain is provided cost-free by hosting companies GitHub and Heroku.  The Heroku sites can take up to a half minute to respond the first time if they have not been accessed for a while.)

Thanks.
